## Features

-   Third-party plugins implemented into the main build.
-   100+ plugins built-in.
    -   Some highlights: SpotifyControls, MessageLogger, Experiments, GameActivityToggle, Translate, NoTrack, QuickReply, Free Emotes/Stickers, PermissionsViewer, 
        CustomCommands, ShowHiddenChannels, PronounDB
-   Fairly lightweight despite the many inbuilt plugins
-   Works on any Discord branch: Stable, Canary or PTB all work (though for the best experience, I recommend stable!)
-   Custom CSS and Themes: Inbuilt CSS editor with support to import any CSS files (including BetterDiscord themes)
-   Privacy friendly, blocks Discord analytics & crash reporting out of the box and has no telemetry
-   Maintained very actively, broken plugins are usually fixed within 12 hours
-   Able to update inside of Fadecord through the update tab.
-   Same supporter badges as on Vencord (Don't lose your benefits)
-   Easy to install third-party plugins through the plugin page in Discord.
-   Request for plugins from Discord.

After you ran Fadecord_Installer.exe, it will look like you are just installing Vencord but it will say it is a development build. If it doesn't say it is a development build, please reach out for support in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/abW57VSqz4)

<summary>Using Fadecord (Vencord+) violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine if you don’t use plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is essential to you and getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Fadecord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Fadecord in a server where you might get banned for it

Plugins may take time to be added as I am not on all of the time because of school and stuff.
